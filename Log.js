     *  @summary
     * 
     *  Packages were updated, and by doing so, 
     *  a couple of the template engine's outdated instructions broke, 
     *  causing a forced debug and update of these mentioned instructions.
     * 
     *  *TIP*
     * 
     *  Refactor into async - await.
     *  Build the client side on React or Angular
     *  Refactor the API and the controllers-routes.
